This is the beginning to test the web application. I've used Spring framework on the back-end and AngularJS like a framework on the front-end and D3 like a chart library.

# Instalation & usage

1. Download economic.rar from root folder.
2. Create a database in MySQL called "economic".
3. Import the sql File into import section.
4. Create or update an user with "root" name and without password.
5. Clone or download the source and open the project in Spring Tool Suite.

8. Run the index.html file located into src/main/webapp/index.html like a "Run at server" with Pivotal tc Server Develoder Edition v3.2.
